## What is it ?

Small example demonstrating how to :
- upload audio
- display it with [wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js) for playing
- recording part of the audio and exporting it

## Issue

After clicking the "record" button, **sound is not played anymore on the webpage**. The exported audio can be correctly read with VLC.

## Notes

`demo.wav` file comes from `https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/blob/3.3.0/example/media/demo.wav`.
